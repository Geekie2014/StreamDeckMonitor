##### ToDo:

* Decide final StreamDeck Mini layouts 


##### Awaiting confirmation of fix:

* Fix Ryzen CPU Temperature references


##### Completed:

* Fixed Configurator app-crash when the contents of both 'framerate max' or 'frame amount' textbox is empty
* Set new layouts depending on which StreamDeck device is connected
* Added ability to change all headers and values height positions (to prevent some fonts from shifting text up/down slightly when adjusting the font type/size)
* Added option to the Configurator app to be able to load the stock default config if needed (without having to manually replace the SharedConfig.cfg with the original from the release zip file)
